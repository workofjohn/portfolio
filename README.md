# portfolio
John's portfolio! Made in 2016 as a project for Web Design.

First draft was done in GitPages too, but this is less for fiddling and more for work!

I don't really understand how to intergrate Javascript so sadly this is running only on HTML and CSS, but hopefully soon I'll be able to incorporate some Java! This page is really all about learning how to make a website for myself, so I'd really love to hear some feedback since I'm having fun learning how to do this!


Enjoy!
